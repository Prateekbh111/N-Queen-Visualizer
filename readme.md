## Introduction

The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial problem in which the goal is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This project provides a visual solution to the problem, displaying the board and the placement of the queens in the console with enhanced formatting and color output.

## Features

- Solves the N-Queens problem for any N ≥ 4.
- Displays the board with borders and color-coded queens.
- Console-based user interface for entering the value of N.
- Enhanced console formatting for better visualization.

## Requirements

- Windows OS (for `windows.h` dependency)
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- UTF-8 compatible console

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/n-queens-visualizer.git
   cd n-queens-visualizer

   ```

2. Compile the code:

   ```bash
   g++ -o nqueens main.cpp

   ```

3. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./nqueens

   ```

4. Enter the value of N when prompted.
